CRUD API to get a record of your cash flow.

Developed with Node.js, Express, MySQL and Angular.

To initialize the server you got to get into the server directory and execute the command 'node start'.

You have to get a MySQL Server instance running in order the make the query to the database succesfully.

Once you got the server running and the Database initialized, go to the frontend/my-budget-app directory inside the main directory and run the command 'ng serve'.

Once the Angular bundle gets build up you can access the API via your Web Browser typing the route: http://localhost/4200/
